# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison using the == operator.

## The Bug
The `foo` function aims to check if two input values (`a` and `b`) are equal.  However, it uses loose comparison (==), which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types. For instance, 0 == false evaluates to true, which might not be the intended behavior.

## Solution
The preferred approach is to use strict equality (===), which performs type checking alongside value comparison. This ensures that two values are considered equal only if they are of the same type and have the same value. 

## How to run the code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment. 
3. Run the code and observe the differences in behavior between loose and strict equality.
